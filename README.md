## Arming process:

1. Angles and plates are cut.
2. Sheets are cut.
3. The first symmetrical angles are drilled at the same time in a single drilling. These would be #1 and #2.
4. Based on the perforations of angles #1 and #2, the angles that execute 90 degrees are perforated, capturing them with a single man to make the holes coincide. These would be #5 and #6.
5. So everything that forms 90 degrees. And in the same way all the parts of the box.
8. The bottom sheet (floor) is drilled based on the angle #3 base front starting with the perforation on the right.
9. #1 Base right is screwed with #5 Right front column and with #4 Rear right column (forming a U between the angles)
10. Screw the #3 base front angle with #1 base right and the floor plate.
11. The floor sheet is drilled based on the rear drilling of angle #1 and angle #4.
12. The left side of the bottom sheet is perforated in the same way, then the front sheet is perforated based on the perforations of the front columns.
