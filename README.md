# Boxes.

1. Boxes may be stacked with each other and join the internal space between them.
2. **Each box** shall have on its exterior a part that allows it to be assembled on any of its sides with another box of the same size or of other sizes, all the boxes shall have harmonious measurements so that they can be assembled together to form figures between them, they shall therefore have a part that allows them to be assembled with another box and can be secured in such a way that only with a key or by opening a padlock can they be disassembled.
3. **Each box** shall have perforations that allow it to be assembled on the floor, on a wall or on the ceiling. On the floor, walls or ceiling there shall be a part assembled with deep holes in the concrete that will allow the drawer(s) to be assembled and secured with padlocks, so that they cannot be moved by anyone but the owner of the padlocks.
4. **Each box** shall be capable of being locked with a key, key or padlock, so that it cannot be opened by anyone but the owner.
5. Aluminium material or (similar in weight, more economical and equal or superior in strength to aluminium).

## Assembly process:

1. Cut corners and plates.
2. Cut the blades.
3. Drill the first symmetrical angles at the same time in a single hole. These would be #1 and #2.
4. Based on the drillings of the angles #1 and #2, drill the 90 degree angles, clamping them with a hole punch to make the holes coincide. These would be #5 and #6.
5. So everything that forms 90 degrees. And in the same way all the parts of the box. 
6. **CORRECTION STEPS 7 AND 8:** Assemble all the right side and from there drill the right sheet according to the perforations of the angles (Since applying steps 8 and 9 to put the screws on the sides does not let you put the key to screw well) From there on, while assembling correct these steps.
7. Drill the bottom (floor) plate based on the #3 base front angle starting with the right hand hole.
8. #1 Base right is screwed with #5 Right front column and #4 Rear right column (forming a U between the angles).
9.  Screw corner #3 base front with #1 base right and the floor plate.
10. Drill the floor plate based on the rear drilling of corner #1 and corner #4. 
11. The left side of the bottom sheet is perforated in the same way, then the front sheet is perforated based on the perforations of the front columns. 

## Tools needed for creation:

1. Grinder, grinder or polisher. For cutting angles, plates and sheets.
2. Drill. For drilling holes in all parts.
3. Single man. For holding, securing, wedging parts when drilling and for securing the nut or bolt while inserting the nut.
4. Wrench. For turning the nut or bolt while holding with the man alone to secure the parts.
