# Aluminium boxes.

These boxes to be assembled in aluminum material have been designed with FreeCAD.

Some boxes have the measures only for the main parts, the other measures of the parts and holes are symmetrical to those created.
## Box dimensions:

1. Box measures: 18x29x47 cms (180x290x470 mm), internally. Using fibonasi sequence measurements with seeds 1 and 3.

### Screws:

1. 22 pcs. 4.8 mm diameter. 17 mm thread length. (4 of 8 mm) (The minimum they must have to cover the thickness of 2 corners and a platen that are the 3 parts of the door that need more length. For the purchased ones you have to cut them) Diameter of the head 9 mm. 3 mm head height.
2. Assembling the box physically, you can see that the screws can be 16 mm long in just the thread.
